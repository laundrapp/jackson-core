 @brief Main public API classes of the core streaming JSON
  processor: most importantly <code>com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.JsonFactory</code>
  used for constructing
  JSON parser (<code>com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser</code>)
  and generator
  (<code>com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator</code>)
  instances.
 <p>
  Public API of the higher-level mapping interfaces ("Mapping API")
  is found from the "jackson-databind" bundle, except for following
  base interfaces that are defined here: 
 <ul>
 <li><code>com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode</code> is included
 within Streaming API to support integration of the Tree Model
 (which is based on <code>JsonNode</code>) with the basic
 parsers and generators (iff using mapping-supporting factory: which
 is part of Mapping API, not core)
   </li>
 <li><code>com.fasterxml.jackson.core.ObjectReadContext</code> is included so that
   reference to the object capable of deserializing
   Objects from token streams (usually, <code>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper</code>)
   can be exposed, without adding direct dependency to implementation.  
 </li>
 <li><code>com.fasterxml.jackson.core.ObjectWriteContext</code> is included so that
   reference to the object capable of serializing
   Objects from token streams (usually, <code>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper</code>)
   can be exposed, without adding direct dependency to implementation.  
 </li>
 </ul>
