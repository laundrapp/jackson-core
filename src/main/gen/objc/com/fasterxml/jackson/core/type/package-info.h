/*!
 @brief Contains classes needed for type introspection, mostly used by data binding
  functionality.Most of this functionality is needed to properly handled
  generic types, and to simplify and unify processing of things Jackson needs
  to determine how contained types (of <code>java.util.Collection</code> and 
 <code>java.util.Map</code> classes) are to be handled.
 <p>
  With 2.9, an additional type (<code>com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.WritableTypeId</code>)
  was added to help handling of type identifiers needed to support polymorphic
  type serialization, deserialization.
